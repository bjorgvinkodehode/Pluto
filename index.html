          Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy
          bodies beyond Neptune’s orbit. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde
          Tombaugh and was considered the ninth planet in our solar system until
          2006 when it was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International
          Astronomical Union (IAU). Pluto is named after the Roman god of the
          underworld and is known for its unique characteristics that set it
          apart from other planets.

        <a href="#pluto"> <h2 id="text2">Pluto’s discovery</h2></a>
        <p id="text6">
          Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh on February 18, 1930, at Lowell
          Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. It was named by an 11-year-old girl
          from Oxford, England named Venetia Burney. Pluto’s status as a planet
          has been debated since its discovery due to its small size and unusual
          orbit. In 2006, the IAU reclassified Pluto as a “dwarf planet” because
          it did not meet all three criteria for being a planet

        <p id="text7">
          Pluto is about two-thirds the size of Earth’s moon and has a rocky
          core surrounded by a mantle of water ice and other frozen volatiles
          such as nitrogen and methane. Its surface is covered in frozen
          nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane with mountains made of water
          ice that can reach up to 11,000 feet high.

        <p id="text8">
          Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx.
          Charon is the largest moon and is about half the size of Pluto itself.
          It was discovered in 1978 by James Christy and named after his wife
          Charlene. The other four moons were discovered between 2005 and 2012
          by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope.

          Pluto remains an object of fascination for astronomers and space
          enthusiasts alike due to its unique characteristics and history. In
          recent years, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft has provided new insights
          into Pluto’s geology and atmosphere during its flyby in July 2015.
          Future missions to Pluto are being planned to explore this fascinating
          world further.
